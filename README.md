# JuliaComputing is anti-open-source

Are there any workplaces or environments where I am encouraged to be my best, where people aren’t threatened by my success?
Julia Computing, Wolfram Research, etc were threatened by my success, they tried to stop me and dim my light. Where’s a workplace I can get paid to win?

I have made many valuable innovative creations and continue to do so, yet there’s no workplace where I am allowed to be my best, they feel threatened by me because my knowledge is out of their control, so they have always wanted to put road blocks in my way ~

It’s getting really boring when they’re always setting up the next road block to try and stop me, because it only makes me more self reliant each time.
I’m already expecting a heavily guarded road block around each corner, so I already worked on my inner strength and self reliance to find my own way through the jungle, where there’s no roads at all ~

All the academic institutions and companies hate that I’m out here working on my projects, and they did everything possible to get in the way and stop me.

Instead of respecting and honoring my [hard work](https://github.com/chakravala), the Julia “community” wanted to steal my creativity without giving back.
They wanted me to be homeless, to be kicked in the dirt, while they steal my creativity.

They intentionally wanted to gang up on me to destroy me and my project because they are jealous and envy it, wanted to “swap destiny” with me.

What they want is to feast on my energy and creativity, while they wanted to suppress and hide me away from public, while feeding off of my hard work.

We all know they got inspired by my [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) project, they ganged up to destroy my project, so that they could feed off my creative energy and put themselves in the spotlight.

I always saw their true intentions and spirit. They are pathetic delusional people on a power trip.

They all ganged up on me to feed off my creative energy, took what wasn’t their authentic idea and pretended it was their own, while suppressing me, the original source of their inspiration.

They were mistaken when they thought they could replace me, they do not have 1% of the creative energy I pour into this world, they are following me.

Trying to “swap destiny” with me is never going to be sustainable for them, they are forever followers, they are people with bad intentions who want to follow my footsteps and pretend to be me, instead of honoring the source and building together.

What they don’t understand is that I am always many steps ahead of them, I am always the leader, I am always the source of this creativity I gave.

They didn’t want to acknowledge the source I am, they wanted me to be desecrated and kicked in the dirt, because they wanted to “swap destiny” with me.

They wanted to deny me job opportunities, deny me support and help, deny me anything and everything.

They denied me the ability to discuss MY project and MY ideas in the Julia “community” and I can’t get any help or support, can’t discuss issues to improve my project, can’t get feedback from the “community”, etc

I can’t open a pull request on the Julia language, I can’t do anything at all in the Julia “community”

Academia has done absolutely NOTHING to support me and my creative ideas. They have actively been against me, doing everything possible to stop me, to prevent me from getting any support or acknowledgement as a source of new ways.

Wolfram Research wanted to derail me also, wanted to manipulate me away from my success, while stalking me like a bunch of creepy weirdos.

Absolutely NO academic “community” has helped me with anything at all, they have only tried to stop me, I have done everything alone by myself. I have not stolen my creativity from others, these people have no idea how hard I worked to build this from scratch, and they wanted to “swap destiny” with me and desecrate the source of it, which was me.

Meanwhile, I helped so many people, answered countless questions in the past, gave infinite inspiration to others, pushed and advanced us.

These people and communities are in for a lifetime of heavy cosmic universal karma.

These “communities” are pathetic garbage.

I was the source of inspiration they wanted to destroy and replace, I was the guiding beacon showing the way, I was excited about helping bring this new way to scientists and programmers. They were a bunch of malicious followers who wanted to suck on my energy and kick the source in the dirt.

Instead of ascending together with me, they have fallen and shown their true character.

For the rest of my life, I will look down on them.

## Who benefits from suppressing open source?

 Who are the type of people who benefit from banning and suppressing open source software developers?
The only people who benefit from banning open source developers are the people who see open source developers as a competition who needs to be disabled.

What governments, what narcissists, what business, who benefits from banning open source competition?

Julia "community" are some of these people who like to benefit from suppressing open source developers.
MIT academics and Julia language people are the people who like to benefit from suppressing open source developers.
Closed source companies like to benefit from suppressing their free software competitors. Governments and narcissists like to think it’s their job to suppress people and technologies if it benefits them.

When you collectively gang up on an open source developer to ban and suppress them, who do you think benefits from that?
Julia community, academia, etc.; all these people and institutions have proven repeatedly that they want to benefit from suppressing open source development.

Academies and universities aren't there to advance society or advance science.
They only exist to inflate egos and to push aside people they dont like.
Academia and universities are 99% politics about who gets to screw who over, and deliberations on how to suppress this person or that person, or how to stop that idea i dont like.

I release free software because I actually build stuff, while the universities and "communities" are busy screwing people over. 

##  Empty words more important than actions, in their "communities"

Actions speak louder than words.
The only thing that matters is the harmful actions by the "julia community" ... it doesn't matter what language they or I use, what only matters is the action of sabotage.

You seem to think empty words are more important than actual actions.

It's all surface level fakeness in the julia community.
They think they can get away with harmful sabotage against other people, as long as they use "nice words" while doing it.

In contrast, I only care about the actions of people and I care less about the form of the words around the actions.
It's the actions which matter in the end ... it doesn't matter what words you dress it in.

People in the Julia "community" think they are justified in harming and sabotaging my existence / contributions; they think because they are the ones using "nice words" that means they are the good guys, even though their actions speak the opposite.

To me, what only matters is the end result of the actions, it doesn't matter how "nice" the words were leading up to harmful actions which cause sabotage.

 Julia / MIT have discouraged me from participating in open source for years now, so of course I am not showing up at JuliaCon again to present the most advanced geometric algebra library in Julia language.

Indeed, the personal feelings of a bunch of power tripping Julia academics have governed the third party interactions between myself and other third parties in the open source community, because these Julia academics are upset that I am independently capable of creating powerful software.
They do not want me to be able to talk about bug fixes, improvements, how to use packages I created, or anything open source related.
This is all based on the personal feelings of a bunch of power tripping Julia academics. Because of these people's feelings, they don't want me to be able to have open-source interactions in their "communities."
They can't just ignore me, they have to ban me on all their GitHub repos, ban me on all their websites, etc.

I do not see anything positive in the Julia "community" at all, I only see a bunch of haters and power tripping academics who are jealous and they want to suppress my open source work from having an impact. 

## World would be better without my innovative contributions, right? 

The Julia "community" has made it abundantly clear that they think it's cool to suppress my open source Julia projects.

If anyone does happen to care about creating an environment where open source projects can thrive, do let me know, but it's been made abundantly clear to me that the Julia "community" only pretends to be inclusive and diverse while they actually think it's cool to exclude people who are different.

If the Julia language "community" were to ban the creator of Grassmann.jl, Reduce.jl, UnitSystems.jl, etc., without just cause, there could be a number of disadvantages for the community.

First, these packages, and the contributions of their creator, are valuable resources for the Julia language community.
[Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) is a package that provides tools for working with Grassmann numbers and other geometric algebra objects, while [Reduce.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Reduce.jl) is a package that provides tools for reducing and manipulating symbolic expressions.
[UnitSystems.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/UnitSystems.jl) is a package that provides tools for working with units and quantities, and Adapode.jl is a package for adaptive time stepping in ordinary differential equations.
These packages provide important functionality for a wide range of applications, and their removal from the Julia ecosystem would represent a loss of valuable resources for the community.

Second, banning or excluding the creator of these packages could discourage other individuals from participating in the "community" and contributing to the project, as it may be perceived as unfair or unjust.
This could result in a loss of valuable expertise and resources for the community.

Finally, banning or excluding an individual with valuable contributions could create an unhealthy or toxic environment within the "community," which could lead to further conflicts and issues.
It is important for the Julia language "community" to strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment that values and respects the contributions of all members.

There are no advantages to the Julia language "community" for banning the creator of Grassmann.jl, Reduce.jl, UnitSystems.jl, etc., regardless of the features of these packages.

A private disagreement, in and of itself, is not a sufficient reason to ban or exclude an individual from the community.

The Julia language "community" benefits from the contributions and efforts of all of its members, and banning or excluding an individual with valuable contributions could have negative consequences for the community.
This could include a loss of valuable expertise and resources, damage to the reputation of the community, and the creation of an unhealthy or toxic environment.
It is important for the Julia language community to strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment that values and respects the contributions of all members.

## Discouraged to document my work

Although I like to commit a lot of my code on GitHub and allow people to use it freely, after all my experiences in the “industry” I am uncomfortable with actually documenting the work I’ve done.

Mainly, it is because of all those people who want to imitate concepts from my design without attribution, while pretending I don't exist and suppressing my existence.

I am deeply disappointed with the Julia “community” and the scientific “community” for all this.

Originally, I was excited about documenting things, but that excitement faded away after many repeat plagiarism instances and attempts to suppress my work.

It feels like there are countless people just waiting to imitate and copy everything I do, which is not a comfortable feeling, because I am not seeing any other behavior.
This is the main and primary behavior I am seeing on repeat: plagiarism and imitating and competition instead of collaborations.

The “community” has given me the impression that they will not respect my authorship, or acknowledge that they are inspired by my designs.
They want to pretend I dont exist, yet they are taking notes and inspiration from my designs without attribution, while suppressing and attacking my existence.

Let’s not forget that at JuliaCon 2019, somebody from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics was supposed to review my paper.
Instead, they didn’t review my paper but made a mediocre imitation project, after tricking me into revealing more information on a video call. Very sociopathic.

Even though everybody wants to imitate me and follow my footsteps in mathematics, I have not heard of any academic institution in the entire world that wants to support or facilitate my work.

This is because they are mostly selfish academic bureaucrats who do not want to admit where their inspiration came from.

Ultimately, they are destined to look at my work and imitate me and follow my footsteps regardless.

I corrected so many misconceptions about geometric algebra, pointed out mistakes and corrected them, but because they are so ashamed for being wrong it’s impossible to get any acknowledgement.

Well, I already published my work for years and those people imitating me and follow my foot steps, just remember that they’re following footsteps they saw somebody else walk.
Most likely they learned something from me or saw how I did my thing and took inspiration.

## Academia is counter-productive

It would seem that the only contribution academia itself makes to scientific progress is to put obstacles in the way to stop people from being productive.

Scientific progress only happens despite all the counter-productive bureaucratic administration.
Science only happens because a person had perseverance to do it, in an environment of academia where bureaucrats intentionally are counter-productive.

As far as I can tell, the only role which academia plays is to artificially limit what scientists are capable of achieving, by constantly distracting people with endless amounts of unnecessary bureaucracy designed to perpetuate itself until it dies.

Academia stops productivity, it is anti-productive or counter-productive.

Academic institutions have made it very clear that their intention is to stop me from being productive in science by the countless actions they take to intentionally be counter-productive.

Julia Computing has made it clear that they intend to stop me from being productive in the open world of peer reviewed software development.

Etc, etc

There are infinite examples of academic institutions being intentionally counter-productive.

It’s not an accident, it’s on purpose. It’s intentionally counter productive.

We’re talking about bureaucrats who have a net negative and counter-productive effect on society.

First they ridicule me, then they ignored me, then some people eventually take these ideas as self-evident, yet they avoid acknowledgment that I was the person who did the hard work of raising awareness about it through my innovation and creativity.
